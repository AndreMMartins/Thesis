 %abstract = {Singular integrals are among the most interesting and important objects of study in analysis, one of the three main branches of mathematics. They deal with real and complex numbers and their functions. In this book, Princeton professor Elias Stein, a leading mathematical innovator as well as a gifted expositor, produced what has been called the most influential mathematics text in the last thirty-five years. One reason for its success as a text is its almost legendary presentation: Stein takes arcane material, previously understood only by specialists, and makes it accessible even to beginning graduate students. Readers have reflected that when you read this book, not only do you see that the greats of the past have done exciting work, but you also feel inspired that you can master the subject and contribute to it yourself.Singular integrals were known to only a few specialists when Stein's book was first published. Over time, however, the book has inspired a whole generation of researchers to apply its methods to a broad range of problems in many disciplines, including engineering, biology, and finance.Stein has received numerous awards for his research, including the Wolf Prize of Israel, the Steele Prize, and the National Medal of Science. He has published eight books with Princeton, includingReal Analysisin 2005.},

Résumé
Nous montrons que les déplacements à déformation bornée dont l'ensemble de discontinuité est petit sont proches (ainsi que leur énergie élastique) de déplacements qui sont réguliers dans un domaine un peu plus petit. Ceci permet d'étendre une estimation de décroissance due à De Giorgi, Carriero, Leaci au contexte de l'élasticité linéarisée, en dimension n quelconque, et d'établir que l'ensemble de discontinuité de minimiseurs (locaux) de l'énergie de Griffith est essentiellement fermé pour la mesure de Hausdorff (n−1)-dimensionnelle.}

We show that a displacement in $GSBD^p$ with a small jump set coincides with a $W^{1,p}$ function, up to a small set whose perimeter and volume are controlled by the size of the jump. This generalises to higher dimension a result of Conti, Focardi and Iurlano. A consequence of this is that such displacements satisfy, up to a small set, Poincaré-Korn and Korn inequalities. As an application, we deduce an approximation result which implies the existence of the approximate gradient for displacements in $GSBD^p$.},

Although close in spirit to Griffith’s theory of brittle fracture, the proposed model however frees itself of the usual constraints of that theory : a preexisting crack and a well-defined crack path. In contrast, crack initiation as well as crack path can be quantified, as demonstrated on explicitly computable examples. Furthermore the model lends itself to numerical implementation in more complex settings.}
