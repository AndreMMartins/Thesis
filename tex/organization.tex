\chapter{Thesis Organization ( Do Not Keep in the end)}

\sections{Questions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item New Proof
    \item Should we do it for random set?
    \item Improve bounds on $\omega$?
    \item importance of weighted inequality
    \item how much BV and BD function should I include?
    \item Should I include the proof of BD for a cube? (yeah and add all the necessary results for that)
    \item Should I add notation section?
    \item Ask for his thesis
\end{itemize}
